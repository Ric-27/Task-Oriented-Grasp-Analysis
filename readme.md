# TASK-ORIENTED GRASP ANALYSIS

## _Analysis tool for the Tracebot project and multi-fingered robots_

Each folder contains the corresponding information.

## Code

The code allows for the grasp analysis of a task-oriented project by providing the force requirements of a multi-fingered manipulator at the object surface.

### Features

- Preview a .stl file on python and extract its information to be saved as attributes
- Transform object surface coordinates into fully constructed Contact Points
- From Contact Points obtain the grasp matrix and its classification
- From Contact Points and a manipulator architecture obtain the grasp jacobian matrix and its classification
- Test for the Friction Form Closure, Force Closure of the grasping system
- Obtain the maximum force alpha the grasping system resist in a given direction

## Presentations
